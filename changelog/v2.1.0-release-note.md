# v2.1.0 Release Note

## Summary
**v2.1.0 has a hardfork, which will be activated at block height 33,350,761
(ETA is around 11/25/2024 01:05:15 AM +UTC) on IoTeX L1 mainnet.**

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, otherwise the node runs the risk of
not being able to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after other nodes have upgraded.

**Note:**
There's no change to the mainnet config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart your node with the new v2.1.0 image.

This release introduces support for the Cancun EVM upgrade, bringing compatibility
with the latest opcodes and Solidity compiler, and enabling more advanced smart 
contract functionality. A key highlight is the integration of EIP-4844, which
supports BlobTx transactions. This allows users to send transactions with blob
data that is stored on-chain for at least 20 days, optimizing data availability
and on-chain storage. Additional improvements includes staking enhancements,
network stability, and overall transaction processing efficiency.

## Key Features and Enhancements

1. Cancun EVM Compatibility: Implements the latest EVM opcodes, allowing developers
to compile contracts with the most recent Solidity compiler and take advantage of
the newest protocol capabilities.
2. Support for EIP-4844 Blob Transactions: Enables users to send transactions
containing blob data, which is verified and stored on-chain for a minimum of 20
days, optimizing data availability and chain storage efficiency.
3. Support for EIP-1559 Dynamic Fee Transactions: Allows users to send transactions
with dynamic fees, where the priority fee is rewarded directly to the block miner,
ensuring fair and efficient fee allocation.
4. Support for EIP-2930 Access List Transactions: Reduces gas consumption by allowing
users to specify an access list in transactions, making execution more cost-effective.

## Bug Fix and Performance Improvements:
1. Staking Bucket Reset: Resolved an issue where staking bucket amounts were not
properly cleared after an unstake, ensuring accurate tracking.
2. Fix for Unlimited Native Staking Duration: Corrected the staking duration limit
for native assets to prevent indefinite staking periods.
3. LibP2P Upgrade: Enhanced the P2P network by upgrading LibP2P, leading to improved
connectivity and network stability.
4. Consistency Between Minting and Validation: Standardized behavior between minting
and validation processes to prevent potential discrepancies and ensure stable operation.

## Upgrade Priority
v2.1.0 comes with a hardfork, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to keep
syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
| API node   | Must upgrade |
