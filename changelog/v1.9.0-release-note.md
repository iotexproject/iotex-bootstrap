# v1.9.0 Release Note

## Summary
**v1.9.0 has a hardfork, which will be activated at block height
21,542,761 (ETA is around 01/11/2023 12am UTC) on IoTeX mainnet.**

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, or otherwise the node
won't be able to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after the 
activation block.

v1.9.0 enables couple of important features:
1. Zero-nonce feature
2. EVM upgrade to London
3. Complete fix to the issue patched by v1.8.4

## Breaking Changes

### Zero-nonce for new account
With this new feature, a newly created account will have 0 as its initial nonce.
For historic reason, our mainnet is launched with that initial nonce value equal
to 1, which is different from Ethereum's convention that the initial nonce starts
from 0. Starting from v1.9.0, this behavior will converge to Ethereum's convention,
further enhancing our chain's compatibility with Ethereum eco-system. In particular,
the Gnosis Safe protocol (which hinges on this zero-nonce property) will be able to
successfully integrate with the IoTeX blockchain after the v1.9.0 launch.

### EVM upgrade to London
With v1.9.0, the EVM has been upgraded to London (and including Berlin), which
enables many important EIPs. For example, EIP-2565 lowers ModExp gas cost and
EIP-2930 provides an optional access list (a list of addresses and storage keys)
to reduce the gas cost when accessing these addresses and keys during contract
execution. Here's a complete list of EIPs enabled in London and Berlin:
1. [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559): Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain
2. [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198): BASEFEE opcode
3. [EIP-3529](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3529): Reduction in refunds
4. [EIP-3541](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541): Reject new contract code starting with the 0xEF byte
5. [EIP-3554](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3554): Difficulty Bomb Delay to December 2021

and EIPs enabled in Berlin:
1. [EIP-2565](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565): ModExp Gas Cost
2. [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718): Typed Transaction Envelope
3. [EIP-2929](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929): Gas cost increases for state access opcodes
4. [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930): Optional access lists

## Other Features and Improvements

### Complete fix of issue patched by v1.8.4
v1.9.0 has provided a complete fix to the issue patched by v1.8.4. After the v1.9.0
upgrade, the manual patch will no longer be needed, and we'll deprecate the patch
in upcoming releases.

### Other Improvements
Couple of small improvements are added into v1.9.0, including:
1. Disable http admin port by default
2. DB will panic when no space left -- better error visibility
3. Fixed slow context in workingset for faster block processing
4. Fixed use of weak random number generator
5. Fixed variadic interface bug
6. Fixed file permission
7. Add ReadHeaderTimeout for http connection

## Upgrade Priority
v1.9.0 comes with a hardfork, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to keep
syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
