# v2.3.3 Release Note

## Summary

v2.3.3 is a major maintenance release that introduces official support for Archive Mode and Prune Mode, providing flexible storage options for different node types. This release also includes significant block synchronization improvements, API enhancements, and critical bug fixes to improve the stability and performance of the IoTeX network.

**Note:**
There's no change to the mainnet config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart your node with the new v2.3.3 image.

## Key Features and Enhancements

### 1. Archive Mode Support
v2.3.3 officially introduces **Archive Mode**, which stores complete historical state data for all blocks. This mode is essential for applications that need to query historical blockchain states at any point in time.

### 2. Prune Mode Support
v2.3.3 introduces **Prune Mode**, which maintains only the most recent 256 blocks of historical state data. This mode significantly reduces storage requirements while still providing recent state access for most operational needs.

### 3. Block Synchronization Optimization
Significant improvements have been made to the block synchronization mechanism to enhance sync speed, reliability, and network efficiency.

### 4. API and Compatibility Enhancements
Enhanced API support and EVM compatibility to improve developer experience and integration capabilities.

- **Web3 API for RollDPoS Protocol**: Added comprehensive Web3 API support for the RollDPoS (Roll-Delegated Proof of Stake) protocol, enabling developers to interact with consensus-related data through standard Web3 interfaces.
- **Web3 API for Poll Protocol**: Implemented ETH ABI compatibility for the poll protocol, allowing seamless integration with Ethereum tools and improving interoperability with EVM-based services.

### 5. Bug Fixes
Critical bug fixes to improve system stability and reliability.

- **WebSocket Connection Stability**: Fixed a double-close issue in WebSocket connections that could lead to connection instability and unexpected disconnections for clients using WebSocket subscriptions.
- **Query Range Limits**: Implemented configurable query range limitations to prevent excessive resource consumption and improve API response times.


## Upgrade Priority
v2.3.3 is a maintenance release, so nodes are recommended to upgrade for better performance and stability.
