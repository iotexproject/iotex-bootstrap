# v1.9.1 Release Note

## Summary
v1.9.1 is a maintenance release, with 2 fixes:

1. Certain build config is accidently deleted, causing git version and commit_id
being missed from the software binary. This is a quick fix to restore that info
so delegate nodes can correctly report the binary version they are running.
2. `ioctl node delegate` command can correctly show all probated delegates now.

## Upgrade Priority
All delegate nodes **must** upgrade in order to correctly report the binary version
they are running.

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Not required |

## Commits In This Release

2. [ioctl] use candidate.OperatorAddress to show probated delegates [#3727](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/pull/3727)
