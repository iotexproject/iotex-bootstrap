# v2.2.1 Release Note

## Summary
**v2.2.1 is a performance and compatibility enhancement release that optimizes
node operations and expands API capabilities.**

All nodes are **strongly recommended** to upgrade to this release, especially
API nodes operating under high TPS conditions, to benefit from significant
performance improvements and enhanced compatibility features.

**Note:**
There's no change to the mainnet config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart your node with the new v2.2.1 image.

This release focuses on optimizing staking view operations through deferred
replication, expanding Ethereum API compatibility with EIP-1898 support, and
introducing enhanced administrative controls for blockchain operations.

## Key Features and Enhancements

1. **Staking View Performance Optimization**: Implemented deferred replication
for staking view copying, significantly improving node performance, especially
for API nodes under high TPS conditions. This optimization reduces computational
overhead during view operations and enhances overall network responsiveness.

2. **EIP-1898 Support**: Added full support for EIP-1898, enabling API nodes
to handle requests with both `blockHash` and `blockNumber` parameters. This
enhancement improves Ethereum compatibility and provides more flexible block
querying capabilities for developers.

3. **Admin Interface Enhancements**: Added new administrative interfaces that
support pausing and resuming blockchain operations, providing operators with
better control over node behavior during maintenance or emergency situations.

## Bug Fix and Performance Improvements

1. **Dependency Management Fix**: Resolved compilation issues where dependency
libraries were incorrectly being removed, ensuring stable build processes.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced overall system performance through
optimized staking view operations and reduced memory overhead.

## Upgrade Priority
v2.2.1 provides significant performance improvements and enhanced functionality.
All nodes are **strongly recommended** to upgrade, with API nodes receiving
the most substantial benefits.

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Recommended  |
| Fullnode   | Recommended  |
| API node   | Highly Recommended |
