# v1.11.1 Release Note

## Summary
**v1.11.1 is an important maintenance release, which fixes a bug in the system
staking contract.** The issue was discovered in a pro-active manner, and 
precautionary actions are taken to make sure that no actual harm/damage is done
to the system staking.

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, otherwise the node runs the risk of
not being able to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after other nodes have upgraded.

**Note:**
There's no change to the latest config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart the node with the new image.

## Other Improvements
v1.11.1 release also comes with a couple of improvements:
1. Enforce height check for system staking indexer to increase error detection
and handling robustness
2. Fix revert message in eth_call
3. Fix panic: concurrent write to websocket connection
4. Fix staking action ToEthTx() panic
5. `ioctl] action transfer` now supports 0x address format
6. Added a new `ioctl ins register` command for INS service

## Upgrade Priority
v1.11.1 contains a mandatory bug fix, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to
keep syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
