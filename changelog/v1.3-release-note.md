1. v1.3 has upgraded to latest EVM version so user can confidently deploy their
DApps to IoTeX blockchain. This EVM upgrade supports the ChainID opcode to
prevent relay attacks and enable cross-chain transparency, and has optimized gas

2. Optimized block sync strategy to make it more robust
3. Fixed a bug that API query needs to wait a little while to return the latest
committed block
4. Fixed a bug that node stops working after network connectivity is lost. Now
the node can detect the network loss/reconnect event, and automatically resume
working after network connectivity is restored
