# v2.3.0 Release Note

## Summary
**v2.3.0 has a hardfork, which will be activated at block height [TBD]
(ETA is around [TBD]) on IoTeX L1 mainnet.**

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, otherwise the node runs the risk of
not being able to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after other nodes have upgraded.

**Note:**
There's no change to the mainnet config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart your node with the new v2.3.0 image.

This release enables [IIP-50](https://github.com/iotexproject/iips/blob/master/iip-50.md), which introduces slashing mechanisms for unproductive delegates. This enhancement significantly improves network security and delegate accountability by applying penalties to the self-stake of delegates who fail to meet productivity requirements.

Additionally, this release enhances candidate registration capabilities by supporting BLS PublicKey registration and updates, laying the foundation for future BLS signature aggregation improvements outlined in [IIP-52](https://github.com/iotexproject/iips/blob/master/iip-52.md).

## Key Features and Enhancements

1. **IIP-50 Slash Candidates**: Implement slashing mechanism that applies penalties to self-stake of unproductive delegates, enhancing network security and delegate accountability.
2. **Enhanced Candidate Registration**: Add support for BLS PublicKey registration and updates in CandidateRegister and CandidateUpdate transactions, preparing the groundwork for IIP-52 BLS signature aggregation.


## Upgrade Priority
v2.3.0 comes with a hardfork, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to keep
syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
| API node   | Must upgrade |
