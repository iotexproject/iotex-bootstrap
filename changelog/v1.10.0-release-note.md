# v1.10.0 Release Note

## Summary
**v1.10.0 has a hardfork, which will be activated at block height
22,991,401 (ETA is around 04/04/2023 11pm UTC) on IoTeX mainnet.**

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, or otherwise the node won't be able
to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after the activation block.

Also we'll use this release opportunity to disable the auto-upgrader, since the
auto-upgrader is a fixed script that cannot adapt perfectly well to each release
scenario, and has caused a couple of failed upgrades in the past.

In the past, if you use the one-line upgrader tool to run your IoTeX node, please
continue to use it to do the v1.10.0 upgrade. This time the script will turn off
the auto-upgrader (if it was turned on before). Run the script below just as before.
```bash
sudo bash # If your docker requires root privilege
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/master/scripts/setup_fullnode.sh)
```

If you use the very long `docker run` command (like below) to run your IoTeX node,
don't worry about the auto-upgrader since it is **not** turned on. Continue to 
upgrade your node using the v1.10.0 image:
```
docker stop iotex
docker rm iotex
docker run -d --restart on-failure --name iotex \
        -p 4689:4689 \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        -v=$IOTEX_HOME/data:/var/data:rw \
        -v=$IOTEX_HOME/log:/var/log:rw \
        -v=$IOTEX_HOME/etc/config.yaml:/etc/iotex/config_override.yaml:ro \
        -v=$IOTEX_HOME/etc/genesis.yaml:/etc/iotex/genesis.yaml:ro \
        iotex/iotex-core:v1.10.0 \
        iotex-server \
        -config-path=/etc/iotex/config_override.yaml \
        -genesis-path=/etc/iotex/genesis.yaml
```

## Breaking Changes
v1.10.0 enables 2 important features:
1. Claim reward via web3.js protocol
2. Node status monitoring by p2p messaging

### Claim reward via web3.js protocol
Similar to how we enabled sending transfer and staking actions via web3.js protocol,
in v1.10.0 claim reward is enabled as well. Delegates can now send claim reward action
using Metamask.

### Node status monitoring by p2p messaging
Currently, the IoTeX node is relying on a pre-defined HTTP port to collect the
real-time running status, such as the software version and blockchain height.
This means that delegate nodes need to open up that HTTP port which might be a
security risk, especially for nodes running on clour service provider. It also
requires delegate nodes to expose their public IP address, which is not preferred
due to both security and privacy concerns, and creates additional maintenance
burden to manually update the IP address in case it changes. 

In v1.10.0, a new node status monitoring solution is implemented based on the
existing p2p network. By exchanging messages about their running status using
the p2p network, delegate nodes no longer have to publicize their IP address nor
open that specific HTTP port. In addition, the external IP address of a node can
now freely change (like being assigned a new IP address after reboot) without
worrying about status reporting/collection.

Also in upcoming new releases, we'll introduce more advanced node status monitor
functionalities. For instance, an automatic alert service where delegates can
register a webhook and receive notification when the node is becoming offline or
entering probation.

## Upgrade Priority
v1.10.0 comes with a hardfork, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to keep
syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
