# v2.1.2 Release Note

## Summary
**v2.1.2 is a major maintenance release to improve IoTeX network stability and
robustness, and expanding API support.**

All nodes are **strongly recommended** to upgrade to this release, to make sure
the node is update-to-date with latest release and ensure smooth block producing.

**Note:**
There's no change to the mainnet config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart your node with the new v2.1.2 image.

This release introduces key enhancements to improve p2p network robustness, expand
Ethereum API compatibility, and refine API service readiness for better system
reliability.

## Key Features and Enhancements

1. p2p robustness enhancement: add a rate-limit mechanism at p2p netowrk level.
This helps to regulate network traffic effectively, mitigate potential congestion,
and enhance security by reducing the risk of malicious attacks.
2. implementation of 2 new Ethereum-Compatible APIs:
`eth_blobBaseFee`: returns the base fee per gas for blob transactions (EIP-4844).
`eth_feeHistory`: provides historical gas fee data for improved fee estimation.
3. API service readiness refinement: during the start-up, the API will wait all
necessary internal components are fully initialized and ready before start accepting
requests, reducing potential API error after service restart

## Upgrade Priority
v2.1.2 comes with an important functional upgrade, all nodes are **strongly recommended**
to upgrade in order to keep update-to-date with latest release and ensure smooth block
producing.
