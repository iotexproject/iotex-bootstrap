# v1.14.1 Release Note

## Summary
v1.14.1 is the first maintenance release after the latest release v1.14.0. It
comes with enhancements across various components such as blockdao, staking, 
API. Also, ioctl commandline tool has a fresh upgrade that supports two new
powerful functions: ioID and w3bstream. The ioID function enables seamless
integration and management of decentralized identities on the IoTeX blockchain.
The w3bstream functions allows for efficient management of w3bstream project
on the chain, from project creation, device registration, to message operation
and prover management.

## Bug Fix and Performance Improvements:
1. bumped go version to 1.21
2. Resolved an issue where the blockdao process could become unresponsive while
checking the indexer. This fix ensures that the node process can receive the
break signal and exit if needed.
3. Fixed an issue where the response ID type in the JSON-RPC API did not match
the request type. This ensures consistency and reliability in web3js API.
4. Enhanced the deserialization process when retrieving block receipts, resulting
in faster access and improved overall performance of the blockdao component.
5. Fixed wrong cache for API readState at tip height, now the cache always returns
most accurate and latest result.

## New Features and Enhancements
1. Added endorsement details to the bucket fetch APIs, providing more comprehensive
information for stakeholders and improving transparency within the staking process.
2. Implemented rate limiting for the WebSocket API to prevent abuse and ensure
fair usage. This enhancement protects the network from potential overload and
improves service stability.
3. Enabled the ToEthTx function for grantReward action, allowing it to be processed
as an Ethereum-compatible transaction. This improvement facilitates interoperability
and expands the utility of the IoTeX blockchain.
4. Added 2 new commands `ioid` and `ws` to ioctl commandline tool. Enables the ioID
management and w3bstream project functions.

## Upgrade Priority
v1.14.1 does not have a hardfork, but contains several bug fixes, performance
improvements, and new feature enhancements. All delegate nodes and API nodes are
recommended to upgrade to v1.14.1 in order to provide the best up-to-date service

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Recommended  |
| Fullnode   | Not required |
| API node   | Recommended  |
