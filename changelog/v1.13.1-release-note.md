# v1.13.1 Release Note

## Summary
v1.13.1 is the first maintenance release after the latest release v1.13.0. It
comes with a bug fix and improvement of ioctl commandline tool.

## Bug fix
With the launch of v1.13.0 some user reported their old wallet address (like no
transaction for 2 years) cannot send out transaction. The issue is quickly
identified to relate to action pool processing the transaction's nonce, and is
properly fixed in this release.

## Other Improvements
In v1.13.1, the ioctl commandline tool has enabled querying delegate's reward
amount by name. As of now you can only query the reward amount by the actual
reward address. With the functionality of querying by name, it makes delegate
more convinient to check their reward and improves user experience.

## Upgrade Priority
v1.13.1 does not have a hardfork, but contains a bug fix to ensure prompt transaction
processing. All delegate nodes and API nodes are strongly recommended to upgrade to
v1.13.1 in order to provide the best up-to-date service

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Recommended  |
| Fullnode   | Not required |
| API node   | Recommended  |
