# v1.11.0 Release Note

## Summary
**v1.11.0 has a hardfork, which will be activated at block height
24,838,201 (ETA is around 07/20/2023 11pm UTC) on IoTeX mainnet.**

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, or otherwise the node won't be able
to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after the activation block.

**Note:**
You must upgrade to the latest config.yaml and genesis.yaml before re-starting the
node. These 2 files contain new configurations necessary for v1.11.0 to work correctly. 

## Breaking Changes
v1.11.0 enables 3 important features:
1. IIP-13 Represent Staking Buckets As Non-fungible Tokens
2. IIP-14 Account Abstraction
3. Enforce ChainID in transaction to prevent possible replay

### IIP-13 Represent Staking Buckets As Non-fungible Tokens
IIP-13 supports native representation of staking buckets as Non-fungible Tokens
on the IoTeX blockchain, which opens opportunities for applications such as
Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD), where these buckets can be traded or used as
collateral in other DeFi protocols. This in turn increases the overall staking
ratio and therefore enhances the degrees of security and decentralization of the
IoTeX blockchain.

### IIP-14 Account Abstraction
IIP-14 Account abstraction is a ground-breaking proposal that aims to enhance
the IoTeX platform by abstracting various account operations and properties,
such as authentication, authorization, replay protection, gas payment, batching,
and atomicity. IIP-14, based on EIP-4337, makes IoTeX a more user-friendly and
secure platform, surpassing the limitations of externally owned accounts (EOAs).
For more information on the implementation details, please refer to â€‹our github
repo [here](https://github.com/iotexproject/account-abstraction-contracts)

### Enforce ChainID in transaction for enhanced transaction security
In v1.8 release, we added ChainID into transaction to distinguish transactions on
different networks. In this v1.11 release, the additional constraint is enforced
that each transaction must bear with it the correct ChainID (1 for mainnet, and 2
for testnet), and the default ChainID value 0 will be rejected. This would further
enhance the security of the IoTeX blockchain.

## Other Improvements
v1.11 release also comes with a couple of small improvements:
1. Added an `ioctl bc delegate` command to retrieve the detailed info of a delegate
2. Added summary about the node status into console log output
3. Enabled message batch in API service to improving network data efficiency
4. Added an `ioctl did service` command
5. Added system action validation step in the block validation process

## Upgrade Priority
v1.11.0 comes with a hardfork, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to keep
syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
