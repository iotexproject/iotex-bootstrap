# v1.13.0 Release Note

## Summary
**v1.13.0 has a hardfork, which will be activated at block height 28,516,681
(ETA is around 02/19/2024 00:58am UTC) on IoTeX mainnet.**

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, otherwise the node runs the risk of
not being able to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after other nodes have upgraded.

**Note:**
There's no change to the mainnet config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart your node with the new v1.13.0 image.

v1.13.0 marks a substantial advancement by upgrading IoTeX network's EVM to the
latest Shanghai version. This upgrade brings in the new opcodes and improvements
in Shanghai EVM, reducing gas cost with enhanced efficiency and reliability of
smart contract execution, ultimately leading to a smoother and more cost-effective
experience on the IoTeX network.

We are also excited to announce that v1.13.0 has enabled deterministic deployment
functionality on the IoTeX network! This feature would deploy a proxy contract
at a fixed address (same for all blockchains), and then it can be used to deploy
any contract to a deterministic address using CREATE2. This ensures that any
contract could be deployed consistently across different blockchain platforms to
the same address, eliminates possible variations, and greatly enhance the 
predictability and reliability of smart contract deployment processes, providing
developers with greater confidence in their deployments and facilitating seamless
integration with other systems and protocols.

## Other Improvements
v1.13.0 release also comes with a couple of improvements:
1. Supported javascript tracing for web3 api `debug_traceCall`
2. `ioctl` commandline tool added more w3bstream project commands, and set
default endpoint to IoTeX mainnet
3. Add operator address into node's metrics reporting
4. Updated gas station logic to give a dynamic gas price suggestion
5. Increase max code deployment size to 48kB, same as Ethereum's limit

## Upgrade Priority
v1.13.0 comes with a hardfork, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to keep
syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
