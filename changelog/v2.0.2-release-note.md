# v2.0.2 Release Note

## Summary
v2.0.2 is the second maintenance release after the latest release v2.0.0. It
comes with an API fix to return correct number of total votes for delegate,
and two ioctl command improvements.

## Bug Fix and Performance Improvements:
1. Corrected delegate's total votes for ioctl and API query.
2. Fixed the issue that certain ioctl commands are missing transaction hash in
the send result display.
3. Showed delegate's ID in `ioctl bc delegate` command output.

## Upgrade Priority
v2.0.2 does not have a hardfork, but contains several API and ioctl command fixes.
All API nodes are recommended to upgrade to v2.0.2 in order to provide the most
up-to-date results and service

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Not required |
| Fullnode   | Not required |
| API node   | Recommended  |
