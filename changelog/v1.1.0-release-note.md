# v1.1.0 release note

1. Reclaim bucket
You can now transfer the ownership of a bucket that is earlier staked by a private key/account in hardware wallet to another designated address.
How it works is that you sign a message using the hardware wallet to prove your ownership of the original bucket and designate a new address, and upon verification, that bucket will be transferred to the new address on IoTeX blockchain.
Go to https://member.iotex.io/reclaim-bucket/, or download the latest ioctl tool, type in "ioctl stake2 reclaim", and follow the instruction.

2. Transaction log
One important aspect of blockchain is record of all transactions involving token change-hand for accounting/auditing purpose. v1.1.0 release has added this capability by providing 2 more gRPC APIs:
"GetTransactionLogByActionHash": query transaction logs by action hash
"GetTransactionLogByBlockHeight": query transaction logs by block height
refer to https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-proto/tree/v0.4.0 for more details about latest API

3. Staking data
The latest ioctl tool provides better visibility of the staking data. These new commands are available in latest ioctl tool:
"ioctl account balance io000000000000000000000000stakingprotocol": this shows the total amount of staked token
"ioctl account balance io0000000000000000000000rewardingprotocol": this shows the total amount of available rewards

4. Image optimization
v1.1.0 also brings more lean and secure binaries by switching the docker base image to Alpine, a lightweight and secure Linux distribution. As a result, the image size reduced from 1.99GB to only 93.9MB, which enables a faster download and easier installation.
