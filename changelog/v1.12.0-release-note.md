# v1.12.0 Release Note

## Summary
**v1.12.0 has a hardfork, which will be activated at block height
26,704,441 (ETA is around 11/05/2023 23:59pm UTC) on IoTeX mainnet.**

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, otherwise the node runs the risk of
not being able to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after other nodes have upgraded.

**Note:**
There's no change to the mainnet config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart your node with the new image.

v1.12.0 marks a substantial advancement by upgrading the EVM to the Bellatrix
release, surpassing the previous London release. Furthermore, our team is actively
preparing for the imminent Shanghai release, with more desired features planned
for subsequent releases.

v1.12.0 has also enabled weighted vote counting for the Staking Bucket NFT, a
feature newly launched in July with version 1.11.0. As a result, buckets created
under this new feature will now enjoy an equal voting power and receive identical
rewards as those of native buckets with equal balances. 

## Other Improvements
v1.12.0 release also comes with a couple of improvements:
1. Add `ioctl bc delegate` command, allowing users to conveniently access the
detailed information of any delegate by name or operator address
2. Fix json unmarshal error when calling `eth_getTransactionByHash` via ethclient

## Upgrade Priority
v1.12.0 comes with a hardfork, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to keep
syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
