# v2.0.0 Release Note

## Summary
**v2.0.0 has a hardfork, which will be activated at block height 31,174,201
(ETA is around 07/22/2024 00:05:55 AM UTC) on IoTeX mainnet.**

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, otherwise the node runs the risk of
not being able to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after other nodes have upgraded.

**Note:**
There's no change to the mainnet config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart your node with the new v2.0.0 image.

We are excited to unveil IoTeX Blockchain v2.0.0, a milestone in our journey
towards a more scalable, secure, and user-centric blockchain ecosystem. This
release introduces impactful features designed to elevate user experience and
expand the capabilities of our staking eco-system, and includes enhancements
aimed at improving the security and robustness of the blockchain system.

Users and developers are encouraged to review the updated documentation and
migration guides ahead of the release to fully leverage these new features. We
are excited to continue empowering decentralized infra for DePIN globally with
the new IoTeX Blockchain v2.0.0 release.

## Key Features and Enhancements
1. New NFT staking contract: introducing a new NFT staking contract that offers
users enhanced flexibility and reduced constraints when staking their tokens
2. Migrate native staking bucket to NFT staking: users with native staking buckets
can now seamlessly migrate to NFT-based staking, enjoying the benefits and flexibility
provided by NFT-based staking
3. Delegate ownership transfer: delegates now have the option to transfer their
ownership to newcomer, providing a streamlined process for management changes
4. Enhanced transaction handling: transactions sent in web3js API/format are now
wrapped in a general container format, which improves accuracy of execution and
compatibility across various tools and frameworks

## Bug Fix and Performance Improvements:
1. Purge failed transactions: failed transactions are automatically purged from
the action pool, ensuring they do not hinder block production. This enhancement
optimizes network efficacy, reliability, and throughput.
2. Error handling in EVM module: handles missing transaction logs on contract's
SelfDestruct() and managing unrecoverable errors effectively, enhancing robustness
and stability of the system by ensuring that critical errors are properly taken
care of

## Upgrade Priority
v2.0.0 comes with a hardfork, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to keep
syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
| API node   | Must upgrade |
