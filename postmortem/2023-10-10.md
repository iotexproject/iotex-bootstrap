# Abstract

During the testing of the Staking as NFT(IIP-13) feature on Mainnet, it was found that the vote calculation of the NFT Bucket was incorrect. This resulted in a slight decrease in the calculation of delegate total votes and the distribution of bucket rewards. To fix this issue, a hard fork upgrade is required.

# Cause

The votes for the NFT Bucket only calculate the staked amount and does not consider the weighting of stake duration and stake-lock.

**Incorrect calculation** 

$`votes=amount`$

**Correct calculation**

$`votes=amount*(1+\log_{1.2}{(duration/86400)(1+m)})`$

$`
m= \begin{cases}
    1 & lockedÂ \\
 0 & unlocked
\end{cases}
`$

# Solution

Using the accurate formula for vote calculation post hard-fork height. State patching is unnecessary as NFT votes are calculated in real-time, instead of being stored in the database. Also ensure the consistency of the vote calculation formula across blockchain, rewarding service, and web/mobile.

We calculate the rewards for NFT staking from epoch 37021(SystemStaking contract deployed) to 39613(hard-fork activated) based on the new reward rules and provide users with a one-time supplemental payment for the difference. The details are shown below:

| Reward Address (io)                                | Reward Address (eth)                                 | Rewards (IOTX) |

# Impact

The main impacts consist of three aspects:
- On-chain data: NFT Bucket rewards are calculated incorrectly.
- Partnerships: Integration progress with LSD partnership could be delayed.
- Teams: Hard fork exhausts the team's human resources.

# Activities

- 2023-09-28 08:20 : Inconsistency found between the displayed Votes on the web and the blockchain
- 2023-09-28 08:20 : After a small discussion, it was decided to align the web and reward distribution with blockchain
- 2023-09-29 08:20 : Internal testing of Staking as NFT feature initiated on the mainnet
- 2023-10-09 05:11 : Feedback received by the group regarding NFT staking bonus votes being zero
- 2023-10-09 16:11 : After a wide-range discussion, it was decided to fix the vote counting method on blockchain and synchronize the changes to the web and rewarding service
- 2023-11-06 07:59:45: Redsea hard-fork is activated

# Why does this issue happen?

- Why use incorrect formula
  - The focus was mainly on the processing logic of the NFT bucket itself, such as stake, restake-related procedures. The correctness of the vote counting logic was somewhat neglected.
  - It was assumed that it was equal to the amount without raising this issue.
  - The correct formula was not found, and the programming pattern needs to be improved.
  - Business background is not well understood
- Why not discover during testnet
  - During unit testing, there was a misconception about vote counting, and the test case was incorrectly written. A formal test case review process is missing
  - Missing comparison of votes data during system integration testing(between chain and analystics)
- Why not discover during code review
  - The PR was too large, making code review more challenging
  - The code review was not meticulous enough.

# How can we avoid it in the future? 

- Raise any doubts you may have
- Keep PRs as small as possible
- Enhance Testing
  - Review test cases more carefully
  - Prepare a test plan for major upgrades
  - Monitor data consistency among multiple systems
- Think as the perspective of user
