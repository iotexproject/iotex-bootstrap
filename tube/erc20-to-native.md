##  Get the receiving address

The receiving address is the underlying ETH address of the IoTeX address on which you wish to receive IOTX native token. 

Usually if you use Metamask, or our [web wallet](https://iotexscan.io/wallet), you may want to receive IOTX token in the same address. In this case, use the ETH address corresponding to the private key as receiving address.

If you use wallet app on mobile phone and wish to receive IOTX native token in the same wallet, you will need to use `ioctl` commandline tool to get the ETH address from the IoTeX native token address, as introduced in [tube](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/tube/tube.md).

##  Send IOTX ERC20 token to swap contract

We have deployed a swap contract [0x450caB2535D57cE9df625297D796aee266611728](https://etherscan.io/address/0x450caB2535D57cE9df625297D796aee266611728) on Ethereum. The abi of this contract is available [here](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/tube/e2n.abi)

Call this contract's depositTo() method with `_amount = amount you want to swap`, and `_to = receiving address above`.

Make sure you have enough amount of IoTeX ERC20 token and Ether (to cover transaction fee on Ethereum) in your sending address.

##  Verify receiving of IOTX native token

The swap should take effect in about 2 minutes. You can check the IOTX native token in the receiving IoTeX address (use *io14s0vgnj0pjnazu4hsqlksdk7slah9vcfscn9ks* as example):

`ioctl account balance io14s0vgnj0pjnazu4hsqlksdk7slah9vcfscn9ks`
